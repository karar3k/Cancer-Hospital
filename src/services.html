		<h2>What is Diagnostic Imaging?</h2>
		<p>Diagnostic imaging refers to a broad range of non-invasive medical imaging techniques that allow healthcare professionals to see inside the body and diagnose a wide range of conditions. These techniques include:</p>
		<ul id="line">
			<li>X-ray imaging</li>
			<li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</li>
			<li>Computed Tomography (CT) scanning</li>
			<li>Ultrasound imaging</li>
			<li>Nuclear medicine imaging</li>
			<li>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning</li>
		</ul>

        </br>
		<h2>How Does Diagnostic Imaging Work?</h2>
		<p>Each type of diagnostic imaging works differently, but they all use some form of energy to produce images of the body's internal structures. For example, X-rays use radiation, MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves, CT scanning uses X-rays from different angles, ultrasound uses sound waves, nuclear medicine imaging uses radioactive substances, and PET scanning uses a radioactive substance called a tracer.</p>

        </br>
		<h2>Why is Diagnostic Imaging Important?</h2>
		<p>Diagnostic imaging is a crucial tool in modern medicine as it helps healthcare professionals diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions. It allows doctors to see inside the body without the need for invasive procedures, which can reduce patient discomfort and complications. Diagnostic imaging can also be used to monitor the progression of a disease and the effectiveness of treatment.</p>

        <h2>What is Chemotherapy?</h2>
		<p>Chemotherapy, often referred to simply as "chemo," is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered intravenously, but can also be given orally or topically depending on the type and stage of cancer.</p>

        </br>
		<h2>How Does Chemotherapy Work?</h2>
		<p>Chemotherapy drugs work by targeting rapidly dividing cells, which is a characteristic of cancer cells. However, they can also affect other rapidly dividing cells in the body, such as those in the hair follicles and digestive tract, which can cause side effects such as hair loss and nausea. The goal of chemotherapy is to kill cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells.</p>

        </br>
		<h2>Types of Chemotherapy Drugs</h2>
		<p>There are several different types of chemotherapy drugs, each of which works in a slightly different way. Some common types include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Alkylating agents</li>
			<li>Antimetabolites</li>
			<li>Antitumor antibiotics</li>
			<li>Topoisomerase inhibitors</li>
			<li>Plant alkaloids</li>
			<li>Hormone therapy</li>
		</ul>

        </br>
		<h2>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h2>
		<p>Chemotherapy can cause a range of side effects, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
			<li>Hair loss</li>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Loss of appetite</li>
			<li>Mouth sores</li>
			<li>Blood disorders</li>
			<li>Increased risk of infection</li>
			<li>Infertility</li>
		</ul>

        </br>
		<h2>Managing Side Effects</h2>
		<p>There are several ways to manage the side effects of chemotherapy, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Anti-nausea medication</li>
			<li>Scalp cooling to reduce hair loss</li>
			<li>Rest and exercise</li>
        </ul>
